<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> purpose of this book is to state simply
and clearly the ways and means necessary to
obtain the largest returns from small plots
of land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conditions are anything but ideal in
the case of many plots that will be used as
“war gardens.” To tell how to overcome
these adverse conditions, either by adapting
the crop to soil and situation, or by modifying
the soil to suit the crop, is one of the
primary objects of this book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the writer’s varied experience with
back-yard and vacant-lot gardens, questions
relating to soils and fertilizers, insects and
diseases, when and what to plant, etc., are
continually cropping up. Answers to these
questions are given here without theorizing
or going into needless details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is essentially a practical book, designed
to help those who desire to raise their
own vegetables in a limited space.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE VALUE OF BACK-YARD AND VACANT-LOT GARDENING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> National War Garden Commission
has estimated that “the people of this
country in 1917 produced a crop valued at
three hundred and fifty million dollars in
gardens cultivated in back yards, on vacant
lots, and on other land previously untilled.”
This may seem a small amount when compared
with the value of the crops raised by
the farmers and market gardeners, but it is
not to be despised, and it shows that something
can be done to increase the food supply
by home gardening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The raising of vegetables at home not only
increases food production, but also stimulates
the consumption of vegetables, thus releasing
staples, such as wheat and meat, for the use
of our soldiers and the Allies. This result is
attained partly because fresh vegetables are
more appetizing than shop-worn products and
partly because of the attitude of the raiser,
who says, “We have the stuff and may as
well eat it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reduction in the cost of living is also
a factor that must be considered. When
vegetables are bought their purchase price
is quite a considerable item in the household
budget. Of course if labor is figured in the
cost of raising vegetables at home the financial
returns are not likely to be large unless
you take into consideration the fact that the
necessity of paying dues for gymnasium, tennis,
or golf is entirely eliminated. Plenty of
fresh air <span class='it'>and</span> exercise can be obtained in
gardening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Home gardening, too, should help the
transportation problem to a certain extent.
Most of the vegetables consumed in the large
cities are transported a considerable distance,
and if those people who eat these much-traveled
vegetables raise their own, the transportation
system will be relieved to that
amount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The raising and caring for plants is certain
to broaden one’s interest. Very few people
who cultivate a vegetable-garden, or any
other kind of garden, for that matter, are
likely to be satisfied until they know something
of the physiology of plants, how and
why they grow, and the principles underlying
successful plant culture. The insects, both
beneficial and otherwise, that one becomes
acquainted with in the garden also add their
quota of interest. The life histories of many
of them are strange and marvelous, and it is
worth while, both from the point of view of
the welfare of the crops and from the educational
standpoint, to learn something of
their habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is probably in the larger aspects of
the situation that the home-garden movement
will ultimately be of greatest value to
the nation. America is not a gardening nation
judged from European standards, but
this agitation for the production of food by
every one who has, or can obtain, a plot of
ground is going to make us one. Those
people who have once cultivated the ground
and raised plants will have had their interest
stimulated, and when the food shortage is
over their activities will find an outlet in the
production of flowers, which cannot but result
in more beautiful cities and happier
citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A healthier population will result from the
exercise in the open air and we shall become
a less nervous and restless people through
our association with the vital soil and living,
growing plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span></p>
<div><h1>II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HOW TO MAKE A START—COMMUNITY GARDENS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> casting about for ways and means of
starting a food-garden, by all means
investigate the advisability of joining up
with, or inaugurating, a community garden.
There are tremendous possibilities in connection
with co-operative efforts in developing
vacant lots and making them productive,
not in the sense of the real-estate man, but
as food-producing plots, designed to reduce
the cost of living, and, incidentally, in many
cases, to clean up and make presentable
what was formerly a neighborhood eyesore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many advantages to be gained
by a neighborhood group combining together
for gardening operations. Usually it is not
difficult in most cities to find large plots of
vacant land with owners who are only too
glad to have them cultivated. By co-operative
effort it is possible to hire a team and
plow and have such plots plowed at a trifling
expense, whereas by individual effort it is
seldom possible to obtain sufficient land to
warrant the expense of hiring a team for
plowing, even though the plot were large
enough for the team to turn around on. A
community garden organization can buy
garden tools, such as wheelbarrows, wheel-hoes,
a sprayer, and other comparatively
costly tools, which greatly facilitate the work
of caring for the plot, but which it would be
impossible or unwise for an individual to
buy if he wished to come anywhere near
making a profit on his garden. Seeds and
fertilizers can be bought to much greater advantage,
and more cheaply when obtained
in bulk, with the added advantage that of
such seeds as tomato, egg-plant, peppers and
celery, one packet is usually enough for the
whole organization, whereas by individual
effort it would be necessary for each gardener
to buy his own packet of seed, resulting in
considerable waste. Waste is not to be condoned
at any time, especially now when
seeds of some vegetables are scarce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have in mind a community organization
a description of which will serve to illustrate
what can be done by organized effort of this
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A piece of land about three acres in extent
was available for cultivation in this case.
It was fairly good land, but had served to
some extent as a dumping-ground for cellar
excavations, and had a considerable amount
of rubbish of one kind and another deposited
upon it. The principal of an adjacent school
decided that this land ought not to remain
idle, so he obtained permission from the owner
to use it, and then, with some other energetic
people of the community, got together and
started to do things. The ground was first
plowed and harrowed free of charge by the
city park department and the largest of the
stones removed. It was then decided that
the plot should be fenced, in order to keep
out cats, dogs, small boys, and other undesirables,
and to insure that those who
raised the crops should receive the benefit.
Material, consisting of two-by-four-inch posts
eight feet long, chicken netting five feet wide,
and a strand of barbed wire to go around the
top, was bought for this purpose at a cost of
about $112. The fence was erected by
volunteers in their spare time, and six padlocked
gates provided, to which each plot-holder
had a key. Water-pipe was laid all
over the area so that the crops could be cared
for in time of drought. The expense incurred
for the purchase of pipe and installation,
together with that of seeds, fertilizers,
and the larger garden implements, was borne
by the association. The area was divided
into fifty plots each 100 × 23½ feet. Each
plot-holder was asked to keep an account of
his expenses, and also of the yields obtained.
The results are interesting. The average
cost of each plot, including expenses incurred
for fencing, seeds, fertilizer, etc., was a little
over $11; the value of the crops obtained
was around $34; giving an average profit of
between $22 and $23.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When one considers the smallness of these
plots, it must be admitted that the results
were worth while, and the whole adventure is
very encouraging to those who contemplate a
similar enterprise. Of course no allowance
was made for the cost of labor involved in
preparing and caring for these plots; but to
offset this one should remember that the soil
was not especially good, the workers not
experienced, and then one must take into
account the large initial expense of fencing
the land, buying tools, etc. This year the
expenses will be considerably less and the
yields ought to be greatly increased because
of the improvement of the soil through the
cultivation of the preceding year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other advantages of community gardens
that may be mentioned are these: there is not
so much danger of a plot-holder becoming
tired of gardening and quitting before he has
harvested his crop; community gardening
fosters a spirit of healthy competition, and
each gardener tries to have his plot looking a
little neater, and to produce larger and better
crops, than his neighbor. Furthermore, in a
body of men and women associated in this
way there is almost always some one who has
had a garden before and to whom the novices
may turn for advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While community gardening is undoubtedly
the most economical, and, in many ways,
the most pleasurable method for the home
gardener to produce his crops, one should not
be deterred from the attempt to grow vegetables
merely because there is no opportunity
to link up with an organization. The man
with a back yard can grow some vegetables,
provided that his soil is fairly good and his
plot is open to the sunshine. Even the apartment-dweller
need not despair, because in
most cities it is possible to obtain the use of a
plot of vacant ground, through either the
municipality or some organization formed for
the purpose of dealing with such situations.</p>

<div><h1>III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TOOLS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is unnecessary to spend much money on
tools for use in a small garden. The writer
did very well in his home garden with nothing
but an ordinary round-pointed shovel for
digging purposes, a rake to pulverize the soil
and make drills for seed-sowing, a scuffle-hoe
for cultivating, and a garden line made from
two sticks and a piece of twine. Of course
there are many tools on the market that
greatly facilitate cultivation and make gardening
work easier, but their purchase is inadvisable
unless the size of the garden and
the permanency of its cultivation warrant it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing will be said as to the various types
of horse-drawn or motor-driven implements.
This book is written for those who have to
do their gardening with hand tools or those
who are limited to the hiring of just what
horse-drawn tools happen to be available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the preparation of the soil, probably
the best implement is the spading-fork. It
is easier to work with than a spade and in
most cases is equally efficient. The spading-fork
can be used for digging and, at a pinch,
can be made to serve the purpose of fining
the surface soil for seed-sowing. A spade is a
handy tool to have, however, especially when
any work is to be done in the way of making
beds or forming walks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For seed-sowing the absolute essentials
are very few. A yard-stick or foot-rule for
measuring the distance between the rows is
useful. An even better way of accomplishing
this is to divide a hoe or rake handle, whichever
is used in seed-sowing, into feet and
quarter-feet, preferably cutting in the marks
with a knife. If one is limited to buying just
one tool for making the drills the rake should
be chosen, as it can also be used for fining the
soil and for cultivating between the rows.
A garden line can easily be improvised from
two sticks, sharpened at one end, and a
suitable length of strong twine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the soil is fairly loose and easily
worked, a scuffle-hoe is a very satisfactory
tool for cultivating the surface. On the other
hand, if the ground is hard and stony the
ordinary draw-hoe should be chosen. A small
hand weeder, which can be obtained at a
cost of from ten to fifty cents, is very useful
for loosening the surface of the ground close
to the rows of young seedlings. Look over
the illustrations of these tools in a seedsman’s
catalogue and pick out the one most suited
to your needs. With a little ingenuity, tools
suitable for stirring up the surface soil can be
fashioned at home from old hoop iron or
stout wire fastened on wooden handles.
After a season’s work in the garden you will
discover just what you need in this line, and
will probably be able to make a tool that will
give far greater satisfaction than anything
you might buy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A garden hose of sufficient length so that
water can be applied all over the garden is
an advantage, but not absolutely necessary.
A good rubber hose costs, nowadays, about
ten dollars for a length of fifty feet, and a few
expenditures of this nature sadly eat into the
profits of the garden. As an accessory to the
hose a sprinkler throwing a fine spray, that
can be left running for several hours, is very
useful and desirable, especially if there is no
meter attached to your water supply!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When combating insects and diseases in a
small garden, a sprayer of the atomizer type
holding about a quart of insecticide and
costing between one and two dollars is very
valuable. In a garden of considerable extent,
or in a community garden, insecticides and
fungicides can be economically and efficiently
applied by means of a compressed-air spray-pump
holding three or four gallons and costing
between six and eight dollars. If a large
potato-patch is cultivated, a powder-distributing
bellows, costing about one dollar, is
useful for distributing Paris green in powder
form. A powder-distributer for use in a
small garden can be improvised by making a
small cheese-cloth bag in which the powder
is placed and distributed by shaking the bag
over the plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wheel-hoes varying in price from five to
fifteen dollars—the price depending on the
size and number of attachments—are available
for expediting the work in large gardens.
Some of these implements have attachments
so that they may be used for marking the
rows, sowing seeds in drills or hills, for raking,
cultivating, and shallow plowing. These,
however, are for use on large areas by professional
gardeners, or to delight the connoisseur
of tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To sum up—the tools that it is advisable
for a beginner, with a garden of moderate
size, to buy are: a spading-fork, an iron
rake, a six-inch hoe (of either the scuffle or
the ordinary variety), a one-quart atomizer
for applying spray fluids, and a watering-can.
The cost of these should not exceed three or
four dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Start out with a few essential tools and
add others if you find that you absolutely
need them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span></p>
<div><h1>IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SITE—THE SOIL AND ITS PREPARATION</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Practically</span> all of the vegetable
crops require sunshine, and plenty of
it, in order to attain their full development.
Therefore, in selecting the location of your
vegetable-garden (if it is possible to have
any choice) choose one open to sunshine and
not hemmed in by tall buildings which shut
out the air. A location near big trees should
be avoided, for the trees not only shade
the crops, but their wide-spreading roots also
rob the ground of food and moisture which
the vegetables need. The ideal location for a
vegetable-garden is one open to the south
and sheltered from the north and west winds,
but always with this provision—the soil
must be of a suitable nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brings us to a consideration of one of
the most important factors in successful
vegetable culture—that of the soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soils vary a great deal in their physical
characters and also in their chemical composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sandy soils quickly dry out and warm up
in the spring, and in consequence it is possible
to prepare them for planting and produce
crops much earlier than is the case with
heavier soils. For this reason sandy soils are
usually preferred by market gardeners, whose
object is to get their crops on the market as
soon as possible. One great objection to
sandy soils is the rapidity with which they
lose their moisture by drainage and evaporation.
They are frequently not naturally
fertile and it is necessary to apply large
quantities of manure to make them profitable.
They are also subject to loss of fertility
by leaching. The way in which these
disadvantages can be corrected will be told
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the other end of the scale, almost exactly
opposite in every particular, are those
soils in which clay predominates. Soils of
this type are cold, they dry out very slowly,
and as a result it is late before they can be
fitted for planting. In dry seasons, because
of their water-holding capacity, they are
greatly to be preferred, and plants growing
on them are less liable to suffer from drought.
Clay soils, because of their stickiness, are
very difficult to work, and although they may
be well supplied with plant food, it is sometimes
unavailable because of the sticky,
tenacious character of the clay which does
not provide a good medium in which the
roots may ramify in search of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peat soils and muck lands are made up
largely of decayed organic matter. They are
usually deficient in minerals, but by correct
management can be made to produce good
crops of certain kinds of vegetables. Enormous
quantities of celery and onions are
successfully grown on muck soils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kind of soil most desired by the
gardener is the happy medium that is called
loam. This consists of a mixture of clay and
sand in nearly equal proportions, combined
with a considerable quantity of decayed
organic matter. Such soils are fertile, easy
to work, retentive of moisture, but sufficiently
porous so that the moisture is not retained
in excess. Air can penetrate such soils, a
prime necessity for healthy root growth, and
also necessary for the existence of bacteria
which do so much in making inert plant
foods soluble and available for the use of
plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extreme types of soil previously mentioned
can be greatly improved by judicious
treatment. It will be remembered that one
of the great drawbacks to sandy soils was
the readiness with which they lose their
moisture. The proper treatment for this type
is to add organic matter. This decays and
forms humus, which binds the coarse particles
together to a certain extent and increases the
absorbtive and retentive properties of the soil.
This organic matter is best applied in the
form of decayed, or partially decayed, barn-yard
or stable manure. If manure is not
available a good substitute can be found in
leaves. These may be gathered in the fall
and piled in a heap to decay. Very little
decomposition will take place during the
winter months in the Northern states, and
for this reason leaves that have been piled in
heaps for twelve months or more are to be
preferred. Decay may be hastened by forking
over the leaves two or three times during
the summer. Although decayed leaves are
better than fresh ones for mixing in with the
soil, fresh leaves are better than none at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owners of city gardens frequently
neglect an opportunity of adding humus to
their soil when they allow the leaves of
street trees to be burned or carted away.
The city street-cleaning department is usually
only too glad to be relieved of this duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it is impossible to add humus to the
soil through the medium of organic manures,
as is often the case in city back yards, recourse
may be had to one of the many brands
of prepared humus obtainable from seedsmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Liming is also considered to be good for
sandy soils, as the lime exercises a binding influence
on the coarse particles. Of course
when clay is available it is good to add it,
and mix thoroughly with the sand, but it is
seldom that clay is present in near enough
proximity to make this practice a paying
proposition. Compacting sandy soils, by
means of a roller on large areas, or by means
of the feet in the case of small plots, is good
horticultural practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clay soils, like the preceding, are greatly
improved by the addition of organic matter.
It should be applied in the fall, in the form of
strawy stable manure, and buried deeply.
Leaves also are a valuable addition. Liming
is good, as this causes the flocculation of the
clay particles and renders the soil more open
and permeable by air and water. The addition
of sand, sifted coal ashes, or wood
ashes serves the same purpose. Clay soils
are benefited by being plowed or spaded in
the fall and left rough over the winter. This
allows the frost to penetrate more readily,
resulting in the breaking up and disintegration
of the clods. Another advantage of fall
plowing in the case of land of this type is that
by so doing it dries out more rapidly in the
spring and it is possible to get your crops
planted earlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muck and swamp soils are frequently
waterlogged, and before they will support a
crop it is necessary to underdrain them; but
as this is an operation that is scarcely
practicable for those for whom this book is
written, it will not be dealt with here. As
there is always a lack of basic salts in this
type of soil, liming is practised, usually to
good advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who contemplate taking over a piece
of land for the purpose of growing vegetables
should, if the land has not previously produced
a crop, obtain the opinion of a competent
gardener as to its possibilities from a
gardening standpoint. Such men are usually
available in every community, and as a rule
are glad to help. If expert opinion is not
available, the novice can form an approximate
idea of its value by making careful observations
in the following manner. Take notice
of the vegetation growing on the plot. If it
is luxuriant and consists mostly of grasses it
will probably be all right for growing vegetables.
Dig holes here and there with a spade
or trowel and examine the soil. If you find,
an inch or two below the surface, nothing but
tin cans and broken bottles it is not a safe
gardening proposition. Neither should you
go ahead if you find only a thin layer of
topsoil, two or three inches, above the subsoil.
It is usually easy to tell the difference
between what is known as topsoil and subsoil.
The topsoil is darker in color, due to
the presence of humus, and of a finer texture.
This topsoil should be at least eight inches
deep to get good results. Soils which contain
too many large stones should be avoided, also
those which consist of only a thin layer overlying
a rock ledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most vegetables succeed best in a soil that
is slightly alkaline, and land intended for
garden use should be tested with litmus
paper to discover if acid is present in excess.
Take a piece of blue litmus paper and press it
upon a handful of moist soil. If it turns red
it indicates the presence of acid and the
advisability of liming. Lime is a valuable
element in the soil, as it assists in making
plant foods soluble. It is best applied in the
fall, spreading it over the surface and digging
or plowing it in. It can also be applied in the
spring, but in no case should it be put on so
that it comes in direct contact with manure.
Lime applied with manure causes ammonia
to be liberated too rapidly in the form of gas,
which escapes into the air, and thus much of
the fertility of the manure is lost. When it is
necessary to apply lime in the spring, the
manure should first be dug or plowed under,
and the lime then spread on the surface, and
raked or harrowed in. Use about 20 pounds
of air-slaked lime or 30 to 40 pounds of
ground limestone to 400 square feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thorough preparation of the soil is essential
if best results are to be obtained. This means
that the soil must be broken up and pulverized
as deeply as possible. There are
several reasons for this. Breaking up the soil
to a good depth increases the water-holding
capacity of the soil—a very important point
because of the fact that plants have to take
all of the food substances that they obtain
from the soil in solution. It provides a greater
bulk of soil in which the plant roots may
ramify in search of food. The less fertile the
soil the greater is the necessity for breaking it
deeply to increase the area from which the
roots may draw nourishment. Deep tillage
encourages the roots to penetrate downward,
and plants whose roots go down deeply
in the soil are less likely to suffer during dry
spells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is well to remember, however, that although
it is desirable to have the soil broken
up deeply it is not a good practice to bring
too much of the subsoil up to the surface in
digging or plowing. In farming operations a
greater depth of soil is obtained by using
what is known as a subsoil plow. This implement
frequently is used after the field has
been plowed in the usual way and penetrates
below the topsoil and breaks up the subsoil,
but without disturbing their relative positions.
In gardens the same result is obtained
by what is called bastard trenching, of which
more will be said later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In preparing a piece of ground that has not
previously been cultivated the first thing to
do is to remove all large stones and rubbish
that may be on the surface. If it is a large
area, the work of breaking it will, of course,
be done with a plow. Supposing the land is
covered with a growth of sod, it is a good plan
to go over it several times with a disk harrow
before plowing. This will cut up the sods,
cause them to decay more rapidly when they
are turned under, and insure the soil being
pulverized throughout its whole depth. After
plowing, harrowing is necessary to break the
lumps and to compact the soil somewhat.
The fining process can then be completed
by hand, using a rake for the purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Small areas can be prepared for planting by
digging with a spade or spading-fork. A
trench should first be dug a foot or eighteen
inches wide and a foot deep, provided that
the topsoil extends that far. The soil from
this trench should be placed on one side so
as to be available for filling in the last trench
when digging is finished. Having opened the
first trench, proceed with the digging, turning
each spadeful of soil bottom up in the trench.
The soil can be turned over with greater ease
and more efficiently by always maintaining
a trench when digging. It is the only way
by which sods, manure, and weeds may be
properly buried so that they may decay and
form plant food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bastard trenching is carried out in the same
way as digging except that the trench is made
at least two feet wide and the subsoil thus
exposed is broken up with a spading-fork
before the topsoil from the next trench is
turned over upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When digging, the soil should be broken up
as finely as possible with the spade or fork,
so as to leave no lumps, and all large stones
should be thrown out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Digging or plowing should never be attempted
when the ground is frozen or when
it is so wet that the soil sticks to the tools
used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the soil has been turned over and
broken up the rake should come into operation
and the surface fined so as to fit it for
seed-sowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span></p>
<div><h1>V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FERTILIZERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> most important elements that it is
necessary to apply to the soil in the form
of fertilizer are nitrogen, phosphorus, and
potash.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Nitrogen</span> greatly stimulates the production
of leaves, and an excess of it applied to crops
grown for their fruit or roots is undesirable.
It is contained in all the animal manures,
associated with other fertilizing elements,
and in a practically pure state in nitrate of
soda.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Phosphorus</span> is a valuable and necessary
fertilizer which has a great influence on the
production of fruits and seeds. It is found in
greater or less quantities in animal manures,
and in bone meal. Phosphatic rock that has
been treated with acid is another important
source of phosphorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Potash.</span> The rôle of potash in the soil is
similar to that of phosphoric acid. It is considered
to be a valuable fertilizer for all crops
that are grown for their roots. It occurs in
animal manures and in wood ashes. Muriate
of potash and kainite contain potash in a
more concentrated form, but are difficult to
obtain at present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of these three elements must be present
in the soil for the production of healthy crops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is generally conceded that the best all-round
fertilizer for plants is decayed <span class='it'>barn-yard</span>
or <span class='it'>stable manure</span>. It not only adds
fertility to the soil, but by its decay it helps
to make the mineral particles soluble and
thus available as plant foods. As already
indicated, it also improves the physical condition
of the soil, making sandy soils more
retentive of moisture, and rendering clay
soils more porous. When applied in the
spring it should be decayed or partly decayed,
as in this condition it is immediately
available for the use of the crop. If it is put
on the ground in the fall, fresh manure may
be used and plowed under. By the time that
the planting season arrives it will be sufficiently
decayed. If there is no objection on
the score of appearances, stable manure, either
fresh or decayed, may be applied in the form
of a thin mulch (a layer on the surface of the
ground) at any time when the plants are
growing. The fertility is gradually washed
down into the soil by rain, and a loose covering
of this kind is of additional advantage in
that it helps to prevent the loss of water from
the soil by evaporation. This mulch must
<span class='it'>not</span> be worked into the soil so that it comes in
contact with the plant roots, but should be
left on the surface until it is dug under the
following fall or spring. Discretion must be
exercised in its use. Root crops, that are
already growing luxuriantly, such as beets
or carrots, or crops that are grown for their
fruit, such as beans and tomatoes, would
probably be harmed by a surface dressing of
this kind. Barn-yard manure is rich in
nitrogen, which is a great stimulant of leaf
growth. If it is applied too freely to the crops
just mentioned it is likely to result in an
excessive crop of leaves at the expense of
roots or fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dressing of stable manure two or three
inches thick all over the plot or at the rate of
from three to five hundred pounds to a plot
twenty by twenty feet is about the right
quantity to use when the ground is dug or
plowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Sheep manure</span> is perhaps the next in importance
of the organic manures and is more
concentrated than barn-yard or stable manure.
It can be applied at the rate of forty
pounds to four hundred square feet. It is
better to spread it over the surface immediately
after the ground has been broken
up, and thoroughly mix it with the surface
soil by means of a rake or harrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hen manure</span> is still more concentrated and
should be used in the same way, or as a top-dressing
after the crops have started their
growth. Twenty pounds to four hundred
square feet is a suitable amount to apply.
To facilitate its distribution it should be
mixed with dry earth and kept in a dry place
for a few weeks before it is desired to apply it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the so-called <span class='it'>chemical fertilizers</span>, those
that are sold by seedsmen as “complete”
fertilizers are the best for the amateur to
buy. These at the present time are usually
made up in the proportion of 5 per cent. nitrogen,
8 per cent. phosphorus, and 1 per cent.
potash. Use twelve pounds to four hundred
square feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of the preceding are “complete” fertilizers
containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and
potash in varying proportions. If they are
used in combination the quantities must be
reduced.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Bone meal</span> is a fertilizer which contains
phosphorus and nitrogen. In some of its
forms it is rather slow acting and sometimes
does not become fully available for the use of
the crop until the year succeeding its application.
Use twelve pounds to four hundred
square feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Nitrate of soda</span> is the quickest-acting
fertilizer that we have and is very valuable
for stimulating the growth of plants early in
the spring, when the nitrogen content of the
soil is usually low. It is especially suitable
for those crops that are grown for their leaves,
such as spinach, lettuce, and cabbage. Great
care must be exercised in the use of this
fertilizer, as an overdose will injure or kill the
plants. As it is very soluble, it should not be
applied until the plants are up and ready to
use it, otherwise much of it will be washed
out of the soil and wasted. It should be
sprinkled on the surface of the soil, first
crushing the lumps, and then mixed in with a
hoe or cultivator. An ounce to each square
yard, applied at intervals of about three
weeks, until the crops have a good start, is the
right proportion to use. It is impossible to
lay too much emphasis on the necessity for
care in the use of this fertilizer. It must not
be allowed to come in contact with the leaves
of the crop, or it will cause them to burn and
turn brown. Generally speaking, it is not a
good fertilizer to use on root or fruit crops,
although it can be used to good advantage in
helping young plants of tomato, cucumber,
muskmelon, etc., to get a start just after they
have been planted out. Its use later in the
season is likely to result in the production of
leaves at the expense of fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Wood ashes</span> contain potash and lime. This
fertilizer is a valuable dressing for heavy,
clayey soils, as it improves their physical
condition. It is good for root crops, such as
beets, carrots, radishes, etc. Use twenty
pounds to four hundred square feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is best to apply all concentrated fertilizers
as surface dressings, and then harrow or
rake them into the soil, rather than to plow
or dig them under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it so happens that the soil is not very
fertile and there is only a limited quantity of
fertilizer available, it is a good plan, instead
of spreading it all over the plot, to apply it
only in close proximity to the hills or drills
in which the plants are growing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is important to remember that the greatest
good can only be obtained from chemical
fertilizers when the soil is plentifully supplied
with humus.</p>

<div><h1>VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE KINDS OF VEGETABLES TO GROW</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A number</span> of factors have to be taken
into consideration before deciding just
which kinds of vegetables to plant in your
garden. Some of these factors are: the
nature of the soil, the size of the garden,
the food value of the crop and the ease
with which it may be stored for winter
use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes it is possible to adapt the soil
to the crop, but usually it is easier to adapt
the crop to the soil. A rich loam will support
practically all of the vegetables and produce
good crops. A thin, sandy soil which has
not been properly fertilized is only suitable
for such crops as bush beans, beets, Swiss
chard, tomato, and New Zealand spinach.
Of course other crops can be grown on such
a soil, but not very satisfactorily. Potatoes
like a sandy soil, but it must be well
fertilized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heavy clay soils will grow cabbage, kale,
corn, parsley, parsnips (if the soil is deep),
peas and rhubarb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the soil is shallow it is not advisable to
attempt any of the root crops that make a
long root. In this category belong the long
beets, parsnips, and salsify.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That person is unwise who attempts to
grow potatoes, corn, and cabbage in a very
restricted area. These crops need plenty of
room in which to develop, and when one has
only a city back yard, or a small plot, it is
better to concentrate on the smaller-growing
vegetables. The best crops to grow in the
city back yard are bush beans, parsley,
radish, beets, Swiss chard, and tomato.
Peas would probably succeed if it were not
for the sparrows which pick off the leaves as
fast as they are produced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One is strictly limited if the available
ground is shaded. All the vegetables need
sun for the greater part of the day. Those
kinds which are grown for their leaves are
more satisfactory in a shady garden, and if
the soil conditions are favorable the following
may be tried: beet, cabbage, lettuce, and
Swiss chard. Even these need a few hours of
sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who are interested in dietetics may
wish to choose their vegetables on the basis of
their food value. In terms of the calorie, the
unit of energy as applied to food, we find that
1 ounce of dried beans (seeds) and 8 ounces
of string-beans are required to produce a
hundred calories. Of green corn 3.2 ounces
are needed; of potatoes, 5.3 ounces; of onions,
8 ounces; of beets, 9.6 ounces; of cabbage,
13.3 ounces; and at the bottom of the list
comes celery, of which 23.7 ounces are required
to produce a hundred calories. It is
misleading, however, to take a list of vegetables
with their caloric values and decide,
that because 6.4 ounces of peas contain one
hundred calories, while it is necessary to
have 10.1 ounces of carrots to produce the
same amount, nothing but peas shall be
grown in the garden. The proper basis on
which to make a decision along these lines
is on the amount of calories that can be obtained
from each square yard of ground. A
considerable area is necessary for the production
of a pound of peas, while a similar
weight of carrots could be produced in a
much smaller space. Furthermore, it must
be remembered that the human system demands
a certain amount of bulky foods, and
these are supplied by vegetables low in
caloric values.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are a number of crops that can easily
be preserved or stored for winter use, and this
should be considered when deciding what
kinds of vegetables to grow. String-beans
are easily preserved by pickling them in
brine, and there is no difficulty whatever in
caring for the dry-shell beans when they are
not infested with weevils. All of the root
crops—carrots, beets, parsnips—can be easily
stored in sand or soil in the cellar, and
potatoes are one of the easiest of crops to care
for. Onions can readily be carried over into
the winter if a cool, airy room is available.
All of the crops just mentioned are fairly
high in food value.</p>

<div><h1>VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PLANNING THE GARDEN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A garden</span> can be made without a plan,
but it is usually a haphazard sort of
affair, and it frequently means that much
more money is spent for seeds than is necessary.
Another frequent happening in a miss-or-hit
garden of this kind is a plethora of
some kinds of vegetables and a great scarcity
of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to give any definite information
as to the quantities of vegetables
to grow, as yields vary so much, owing to
the character of the soil and climate, the
variety of the vegetable, and the skill, or
lack of it, of the gardener. The preferences
of the individual must also be considered.
The table in the Appendix giving the
approximate amount of vegetables that can
be obtained from a hundred-foot row may
be helpful. It must be remembered, however,
that these figures are only approximate
and that wide variations can be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When planning your garden you must take
into consideration the sunshine it receives,
and if part of it is shaded reserve that part for
those crops that will endure shade. If there
is any variation in the nature of the soil,
whether in regard to its physical condition,
fertility, or wetness, you should place the
crops accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a general rule the rows should run north
and south, as by this plan each row receives
its share of sunlight. If for any reason this is
not practicable, put the tall-growing crops at
the north end of the plot, so that they do not
shade the smaller kinds. The perennial crops,
like asparagus and rhubarb, are best placed
at one end or side of the plot so that they are
not in the way when digging or plowing is
being done. It makes a better-looking plot
if those vegetables which are planted the same
distance apart are grouped together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plan to have the ground occupied for the
whole season. Many vegetables take a
comparatively short time in which to mature,
and these can be removed when harvested and
the ground occupied by another crop. Thus
peas can be followed by cauliflower or cabbage,
early beets by beans, lettuce by tomato,
and so on. Find out the average number of
growing-days in your locality and consult
the table in the Appendix giving the number
of days required to bring the various crops
to maturity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When planning for succession vegetables,
have some regard to crop rotation. That is
to say, if the ground in the early part of the
season has been occupied by a leaf crop,
follow it by a fruit crop, or <span class='it'>vice versa</span>. Early
cabbage followed by beans may be cited as
an example. Similarly, root crops may be
followed by leaf crops, as early carrots and
fall spinach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another important reason for crop rotation
is that it lessens the danger of loss from
disease. Many of the fungous diseases of
plants are carried over from year to year in
the soil. Some of them are able to live on
only one particular host plant, and if that
crop is not grown in the soil where the fungus
is hibernating the disease ultimately dies out
through lack of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing to do in planning a vegetable-garden
is to measure the plot and
transfer its outlines to scale on paper. Then,
bearing in mind the considerations just outlined
in this chapter, decide on the kinds of
vegetables you wish to grow. Now the real
fun of planning begins! The desires of the
grower as to quantities and variety of vegetables
must be scaled down so as to fit the
plot. Take a ruler and draw lines across your
plan to represent the rows of vegetables.
The distance between the rows may be drawn
to scale to correspond with the actual distance
between the rows on the ground,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> or
you may merely note the theoretical distance
between the lines. Write the name of the
vegetable on each line, with that of the succession
crop, if any. It is a good idea to
mount your plan on stiff cardboard when
finished, and to allow a space either at the
side or on the back for making notes to be
taken during the growing-season. These
notes may consist of reminders that such
and such a crop is not suited in its present
location, the time occupied from seed-sowing
to maturity, the desirability or otherwise of
certain vegetables, etc.</p>

<div><h1>VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SEEDS, SEED-SOWING, AND TRANSPLANTING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Most</span> seeds, with the exception of carrot,
onion, parsnip, and parsley, will grow
fairly satisfactorily even if they are more
than one year old, so that left-overs from
the preceding year may be planted with
good results. Before using these left-over
seeds, however, it is wise to test their germinating
power before committing them to the
garden. To plant seeds which will not germinate
is a waste of time and labor. Testing
the viability of seeds is a simple and easy
matter and very advisable if there is any
doubt. Count out fifty or one hundred seeds
of the kind that you wish to test and plant
them in sand or earth in a cigar-box or something
similar. Place them in a fairly warm
room (temperature about 60° Fahr.) and keep the
soil moist. In a week or two take note of the
number which have sprouted, and this will
give you the percentage of good seeds and
some idea of the quantity you will have to
plant in order to get a good stand. For
instance, if only 50 per cent. of the seeds
germinate it means that it will be necessary
to plant double the usual number to make
sure of having a sufficient number of plants.
Another and less messy way of testing seeds
is to place them on a plate between blotters
or cloth, which must be kept moist, covering
them with another plate to prevent too rapid
evaporation of moisture. Although they
adequately furnish the desired information,
neither of these methods of testing seeds gives
an absolutely accurate indication of what will
take place when they are planted in the
garden. Seeds out of doors are exposed to a
number of hazards that are not present under
indoor conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before planting any seeds outdoors the soil
must be in the proper condition. It must
not be so wet that it sticks to the tools used,
the surface must be finely pulverized with a
rake, and all large stones taken off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are three ways of planting seeds outdoors—in
drills, in hills, and broadcast. The
<span class='it'>drills</span> consist of shallow trenches from one-half
inch to two inches deep, in which the seeds are
sown. The young plants are later thinned out
so that they stand an equal distance apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeds are said to be planted in <span class='it'>hills</span> when
they are sown in such a way that the resultant
plants are in groups of three or more
standing the same distance in the rows as
the distance between the rows.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Broadcast</span> sowing is when the seeds are
scattered over the surface of the ground and
covered by raking them in, or by sprinkling
soil over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A garden line should always be stretched
across the plot as a guide when making the
drills. This insures straight rows, resulting
in an enhanced appearance of the garden
and greater ease in subsequent cultivation.
A variety of tools can be used for making
the drills or furrows. For those seeds which
require to be planted deeply,<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> a draw-hoe is
a useful tool, or, if this is not available, the
corner of a rake will suffice. The shallow
drills can be made with a hoe or rake handle
or with a pointed stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seeds should be planted immediately
after the drill is made, before the soil dries up.
Consult the table in the Appendix showing
the quantity of seed required to plant a row
one hundred feet long, and refrain from planting
too thickly. Being too liberal with seeds
at planting-time is not only wasteful, but
also involves a great deal of extra labor later
on when the young seedlings have to be
thinned in order to give them room for proper
development. Sow the seeds as evenly as
possible and cover by raking the soil over
them. The soil over the seeds must be
firmed. In the case of the larger seeds, such
as peas and beans, this can be done by walking
along the row. The earth over the smaller
seeds is best compacted by means of the back
of a hoe or rake. This firming process is
carried out in order that the earth may come
in close contact with the seeds, so that they
may absorb the moisture contained in it;
also to establish capillary action with the
soil below, resulting in moisture being drawn
up to the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a tendency among beginners to
plant their seeds either on raised ridges or,
sometimes at the other extreme, in deep
trenches. The first method is liable to result
in the plants suffering from drought, and the
latter in flooding, if it happens to be a wet
season. There are times when it is advisable
to make use of these practices, as will be described
when the methods of cultivation are
taken up in detail, but speaking generally,
level cultivation is best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the seeds are planted we are enabled
to sit back and have a breathing-spell until
the young plants appear, when it is necessary
to proceed with thinning and cultivating as
described in the following chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the common practice, in connection
with some crops, not to plant the seeds
directly where they are to mature, but to
sow them elsewhere at first and to transplant
the young plants to their permanent quarters
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Northern states the growing-season
is not sufficiently long to get best results
from such tropical plants as tomato, egg-plant
and pepper if the seeds are sown outside. A
longer growing-season is afforded to these
plants by raising them in a greenhouse or
hotbed, and transplanting them to the
garden when the earth has warmed up and
danger of frost is over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cabbage is transplanted for the reason that
if the seed was sown directly in the field it
would be necessary to plant much more seed
than was actually needed, and because the
ground can be profitably occupied with
another crop while the young cabbage plants
are reaching a sizable condition. Early cabbage
is also sown in a greenhouse or cold-frame
in order to hasten the time of maturity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although it is possible to raise these transplanted
crops with no other facilities than
those provided by the ordinary dwelling-house,
it is not worth while when only a few
plants are required. Young plants of tomato,
egg-plant, pepper, and cabbage can be obtained
at such a trifling expense from seedsmen
who make a business of raising them that
it does not pay to bother with raising them
yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An eye should be given to weather conditions
when transplanting. The plants will
feel the check less if a cloudy, humid day is
chosen on which to do the work. The soil
should be moist, but not so wet as to be
sticky. The hole for the reception of the
roots can conveniently be made with a
trowel. Make it large enough so that the
roots may be spread out and then press the
earth gently but firmly around them. If the
soil is dry leave a shallow depression around
the stem of each plant to facilitate watering.
Sufficient water should be applied to soak the
ground for a depth of six inches or more, and
when it has drained away from the surface,
the depression may be filled with loose dry
earth to prevent the moisture escaping by
evaporation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If for any reason it is necessary to do the
work of transplanting on a dry, sunny day,
the young plants should be shaded. This can
be accomplished by covering them with
inverted flower-pots, or with newspapers
weighted at the corners with stones to keep
them from blowing away, or a shingle or thin
piece of board may be stuck in the ground on
the sunny side so that its shadow falls on the
plant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In most cases, unless they are grown in
earthen or paper pots, the root system of the
plants is injured in transplanting. In order
to restore the balance between root and
shoot it is advisable, and customary, to cut
off part of the leaves. If the whole of the
leaves are left on the plant they wilt and
sometimes die because the reduced number
of roots is unable to supply their demands
for moisture.</p>

<div><h1>IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HOEING AND THINNING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> the young plants appear above
the ground it is time to commence
cultivating. This consists of breaking up and
pulverizing the surface crust. There are
several reasons for doing this. It allows air
to enter the soil, which, it will be remembered,
is a necessity for the roots of plants and has
an important bearing on the formation of
plant food. It keeps down the weeds, and,
most important of all, it helps to conserve the
moisture in the soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All who have had anything to do with the
cultivation of the soil will have noticed that
when its surface is stirred up after a rain it
quickly dries out. It will also have been
noticed that, if any one has walked over this
soil just after it has been stirred up, the soil in
the footprints remains moist. Why is this?
It is simply that capillary action has been
broken by the loosening of the surface, and
the soil-water rises to the loosened soil and no
farther. On the other hand, capillary action
has been restored in those places where the
soil has been compacted by walking on it, and
the surface here is moist because moisture is
continually being supplied from the store
below. This moisture just as continually
evaporates during dry weather and is lost as
far as the plant roots are concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breaking up the surface soil provides a dust
mulch or soil blanket which shades the moist
soil below from the sun’s rays, and in a large
measure prevents evaporation. Therefore,
after every rain, just as soon as the soil has
dried out sufficiently so that it does not stick
to the tool used, the surface should be
cultivated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Various tools are used for this purpose.
When working close to young plants the
small hand weeders are useful. Between
the rows a hoe should be used. These are of
three types. The <span class='it'>scuffle-hoe</span>, which is pushed
through the soil just underneath the surface,
the operator walking backward. This is a
handy tool for small gardens if the soil is not
too hard, and its use gives the advantage of
it not being necessary to walk on the loosened
soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ordinary <span class='it'>draw-hoe</span> is used with a
chopping motion and the operator walks forward
over the loosened soil. It is a good tool
for getting rid of weeds, and is better than
the preceding for use in hard or stony
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many forms of <span class='it'>wheel-hoes</span> which
enable the work of cultivating to be done very
expeditiously. They are pushed forward with
a jerky motion, one step at a time, pulling the
implement toward you before making the
forward thrust, thus gaining momentum
before the teeth enter the ground. Do not
attempt to push a wheel-hoe in the same way
that you would a perambulator—it’s too hard
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To water or not to water is sometimes a
debatable point in vegetable-growing. There
is this much to be said about the application
of water to the garden. If thorough cultivation
has been properly attended to there will
be much less need of watering, and when it is
decided that watering is necessary, let it be
thorough, so that the soil is soaked to a depth
of a foot or so. Then as soon as the soil has
dried out somewhat, stir up the surface so
that the moisture is not lost by evaporation.
The best way to apply water is by means of a
sprinkler, throwing a fine spray, which can
be left operating for two or three hours.
This insures a proper wetting of the soil
without washing away any of the loose soil
on the surface. The next best thing is to use
a hose. The watering-pot is of little use except
in a very small garden, because one gets
tired of toting water before the plants have
been given nearly enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to obtain good crops it is necessary
to allow the plants sufficient room to attain
their full development. They must have
space in the earth for their roots to ramify in
search of food, and room above to spread
their leaves to the air and sunshine. A
number of seeds, including beet, carrot,
corn, lettuce, onion, parsnip, radish, spinach,
and Swiss chard, are sown in such a way
(in order to insure a good stand) that when
they germinate the young plants stand too
close together. These have to be thinned
out.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> This operation should be carried out
as soon as the seedlings are large enough to
handle. Choose a cloudy day when the soil
is fairly moist, and pull out the weak, spindly
plants, leaving the strong, healthy ones.</p>

<div><h1>X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>STAKING AND TYING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Some</span> of our vegetable crops need supports
of some kind to obtain best results
from them. Peas, and beans of some varieties,
and tomatoes are of this nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dwarf peas, which need no supports,
are the best for the small garden, but if the
taller kinds, which are more productive, are
grown it is necessary to supply them with
something on which to climb. Twiggy brush-wood
is the best for the purpose, as the pea
tendrils attach themselves readily to this.
The bases of the branches should be sharpened
with a knife and then stuck firmly into
the ground on either side of the row when the
peas are a few inches high. Chicken netting
stretched along the row and supported on
strong stakes is also suitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pole beans climb by means of twining, and
poles from six to eight feet high and about
two inches in diameter are usually supplied
for them. These poles are inserted in the
ground by first making a hole with a crowbar.
Another method of supporting beans is by
means of V-shaped frames about six feet high
and three feet wide at the bottom. They can
be made of light lumber, such as three by one
or two by two inch rough pine. These are
spaced from eight to ten feet apart and connected
by thin strips of lumber along the
top and along the bases. Strings are fastened
on one of the base strips, carried over the top
and fastened to the base strip on the other
side. These strings should be from six to
nine inches apart. The beans are planted so
that there is one bean-plant to each string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tomatoes may be left to grow naturally,
in which case they sprawl over the ground
and much fruit is spoiled by coming in contact
with the earth, or they may be staked. If
grown to a single stem each plant will need
a stout stake to which it may be attached
by tying with pieces of cloth or tape about an
inch wide. If twine were used it would probably
cut into and injure the soft stems.
Another way of supporting tomatoes is to
allow all the shoots to grow at will, but to
prevent them from falling on the ground by
placing around each plant three or four stakes
connected with barrel hoops or with twine.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>
<div><h1>XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>INSECT ENEMIES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>To</span> be successful in controlling insect pests,
preventive or remedial measures must
be applied early. If spraying is deferred
until insects infest the plants in large numbers,
great difficulty is experienced in getting
rid of them. It is emphatically much easier
to kill a few insects than a whole host. If
they are once allowed to obtain the upper
hand, the crop will be so much injured that
it frequently will not pay to attempt to
save it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The important point that must be grasped
in connection with the control of insect pests
is that they may, from the point of view of the
gardener, be divided into two groups—“biting”
insects and “sucking” insects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The biting insects <span class='it'>eat</span> the leaves, roots,
or stems of the plants attacked, and their
presence is usually obvious even to a casual
observer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sucking insects obtain their food, not
by eating the leaves, but by inserting their
“beaks” into the plant tissue and sucking its
juices. Since it is not feasible to poison the
sap of plants to kill the insects, the best
method is to spray them with what are known
as “contact” insecticides. These must be
applied in such a way that they actually come
in contact with the insects. Soap solutions,
kerosene emulsion, and nicotine are the
principal contact sprays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, instead of using sprays it is
more convenient to use dry insecticides in the
form of powder. This is particularly the case
when a spray-pump is unavailable or the
water supply not close at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No matter in what form these insecticides
are applied, the operation must be done
thoroughly or little benefit will result. The
contact sprays should be applied with force in
such a way that every insect is covered. To
apply the stomach poisons a fine, mist-like
spray should be used which will coat the
leaves with a thin film of poison. If too much
is applied there is a tendency for the mixture
to run into globules, which concentrates the
poison at the tip of the leaves. This may
result in injury to the plants and is not
effective in coating the whole of the leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feeding habits of some insects make it
almost impossible to control them by spraying;
so traps, poison bait, hand picking, repellents,
or screening the plants to prevent
access of insects are resorted to. These
measures are fully described in connection
with the insects against which they are used.
Following are some of the more important
insect pests.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Beets.</span>—<span class='it'>Flea-beetles</span> (small, very active
insects, as indicated by their name), <span class='it'>blister-beetles</span>,
and various caterpillars, which eat the
leaves, attack beets. Lead arsenate<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> should
be applied as soon as the injury is noticed.</p>

</table>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cabbage.</span>—Probably the worst insect pest
of this crop is the <span class='it'>cabbage-worm</span>, a green caterpillar
which hatches from eggs laid on the
leaves by the common white butterflies, which
may be seen flitting about the garden from
early spring until fall. Spraying the plants
with arsenate of lead to which a “sticker”
has been added to make it adhere to the
leaves is a standard remedy. Cabbage is
also attacked by flea-beetles and caterpillars
of various kinds, which are controlled by the
same methods adopted for the cabbage-worm.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cauliflower.</span>—Same pests as cabbage.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Corn.</span>—The <span class='it'>corn earworm</span> is one of the
worst of the pests attacking corn. This is a
caterpillar which at first feeds on the “silk”
and later penetrates the ear and eats the kernels.
It is very difficult to control this insect.
Lead arsenate sprayed or dusted on the silk
as soon as it appears is a partial remedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cucumber.</span>—The <span class='it'>striped cucumber-beetle</span> is
about a fourth of an inch in length, yellow in
color, with three black stripes on the wing
covers. It eats the leaves of the young plants
and if unchecked ruins the chances of obtaining
a crop. One of the best ways of dealing
with this insect is to prevent it from gaining
access to the plants by the use of cheese-cloth
or wire mosquito-netting screens. These
can be made by tacking the material used
over bottomless boxes, not so high as to shade
the plants, but of sufficient width and length
to give them room to grow. Another method
is to place two or three short sticks in the
center of the hill and over these spread a
“tent” of cheese-cloth, holding down the
edges with stones and earth. Tobacco dust
sprinkled plentifully over and around the
plants acts as a repellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>twelve-spotted cucumber-beetle</span> may be
controlled by the same measures and by
spraying with lead arsenate.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Egg-plant</span> is subject to the same pests as
the potato.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Kale</span> and <span class='sc'>Kohlrabi</span> are attacked by the
same insects that attack cabbage.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Muskmelon</span> is subject to the same insects
as the cucumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Onion.</span>—<span class='it'>Thrips</span> is a tiny insect which infests
onions, sucks the sap from the leaves,
and causes them to assume a silvery appearance.
Most vegetables are subject to its
attack. It can be controlled by using a
contact spray, such as nicotine solution or
kerosene emulsion.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Potato.</span>—The most troublesome insect
pest of the potato is the well-known <span class='it'>Colorado
potato-beetle</span>. This may be controlled by picking
the insects from the plant by hand, or
by dusting the leaves with Paris green which
has been diluted by mixing it with fifty times
its bulk of air-slaked lime. Spraying the
plants with lead arsenate is even more
effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>flea-beetle</span> eats small holes in the leaves,
making them appear as if they had been
riddled with shot. The spray treatment
adopted for the <span class='it'>Colorado beetle</span> will also take
care of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Blister-beetles</span> are slender insects varied
in color which attack potatoes and many
other vegetables. Lead arsenate is the best
remedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Pumpkin</span> is likely to be affected with the
same pests as cucumber and squash.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Squash.</span>—This crop is subject to the same
pests as cucumber. The <span class='it'>squash-bug</span>, or <span class='it'>stink-bug</span>
(which also attacks cucumbers and
melons), is grayish-brown in color and about
three-fourths of an inch long. It exhales a
very offensive odor which makes hand picking,
one of the most effective means of controlling
it, an extremely unpleasant task.
The measures adopted against the <span class='it'>cucumber-beetles</span>
are also effective in controlling this
pest. Other remedies that may be tried are
the collection and destruction of the conspicuous
eggs which are to be found in masses
on the under sides of the leaves, and trapping
the adults by placing shingles on the
ground around the plants. The insects will
congregate under these and can then be
destroyed by stepping on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tomato.</span>—The <span class='it'>tomato-worm</span>, the larva of a
Sphinx-moth, sometimes occasions much damage.
Hand picking is a good remedy, or the
plants may be sprayed with lead arsenate.
If the latter course is followed, care must be
taken to clean the tomatoes thoroughly
before eating them. The tomato is also
subject to the same insect pests as the
potato.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Watermelon</span> is attacked by the same insects
that infest cucumbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Practically all vegetable crops are subject
to attack by the following insects:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Aphis</span>, or <span class='sc'>Plant Lice</span>.—These occur in
both small and large species in a great variety
of color. They injure the plants by sucking
their juices, and frequently cause the leaves
to become curled and deformed. Usually
these insects are to be found on the soft growing
tips of the plants or on the under sides of
the leaves. Prompt application of remedial
measures is necessary. The green-colored
forms are usually the easiest to kill, and a
simple soap solution is generally effective.
The black <span class='it'>aphids</span> are more tenacious of life,
and a stronger insecticide must be used, such
as nicotine solution or kerosene emulsion.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cutworms</span> are the larvæ of several species
of moths. They are especially partial to
beans, cabbage, corn, onions, and tomatoes.
They are usually dark-colored, greasy-looking
caterpillars which spend most of their time,
when they are not eating, just underneath the
surface of the ground. They cut off the
plants by eating through the stems. Several
different measures should be in operation at
the same time to rid a garden of <span class='it'>cutworms</span>.
One of the most effective is the use of poisoned
bait, but this is not advisable when live
stock have access to the garden. The bait
should be strewed liberally close to the plants.
Shingles or thin boards may be placed on the
surface of the soil. The <span class='it'>cutworms</span> will congregate
under these and can then be killed
by any means that suggests itself. Hunting
for them at night, when they are feeding,
with a lantern or flashlight, is another
method of reducing their numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two very important soil pests are <span class='it'>white
grubs</span> and <span class='it'>wireworms</span>. They attack potatoes
and the roots of many garden crops. The
former are large, clumsy, white grubs, the
larvæ of the June beetle. <span class='it'>Wireworms</span> are
long, slender, shining grubs, which may be
of any color from light yellow to dark brown.
They are the larvæ of click-beetles. It is
very difficult to control these pests. Frequent,
deep tilling of the soil is probably the
best remedy. If chickens are allowed access
to the garden plot when it is being plowed or
spaded they will eat a great many of them.
<span class='it'>Wireworms</span> may be trapped by attracting
them to buried pieces of carrot or potato.
These traps must be examined every morning
and the insects congregated on them killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following are the formulas for the various
insecticides recommended.</p>

<div><h1>XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PLANT DISEASES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Most</span> of our vegetable crops are subject
to attack by fungus or bacterial parasites
which cause disease. Preventive measures
are the most important in combating ills
of this nature. These may consist of providing
unfavorable soil conditions for the disease,
as in the case of cabbage clubroot, or disinfection
of the “seed” as practised for the control
of scab of potatoes. Other measures are:
the application of protective sprays, which
kill the spores of disease organisms when
they germinate; rotation of crops; planting
disease-resistant varieties; and the avoidance
of material carrying spores of disease, such
as manure containing parts of diseased plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Bordeaux mixture</span> is the standard fungicide.
The formula which calls for four
ounces lump lime, four ounces copper sulphate
(bluestone) and three gallons of water is the
one most commonly used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is made by dissolving four ounces of
bluestone in an earthenware or wooden
vessel in one and one-half gallons of water.
The lime is slaked in another vessel by adding
water gradually until it forms a mixture of a
milky consistency. Add more water to make
one and one-half gallons and strain through
cheese-cloth. After it has been strained it
should be thoroughly mixed with the copper-sulphate
solution and used immediately.
Bordeaux mixture made in this way will not
keep, but should be applied the same day.
Stock solutions of copper sulphate and lime
will keep indefinitely if they are not mixed
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Liver of sulphur (potassium sulphide)</span> is
valuable for spraying plants affected with
mildew. Use one ounce dissolved in three
gallons of water. This solution discolors
paint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following are some of the common
diseases affecting vegetable crops:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Beans</span> are attacked by <span class='it'>anthracnose</span>. It
causes dark-colored, sunken spots to appear
on the leaves, stems, and pods. It frequently
penetrates to the seeds. Infected
seeds should never be planted. It pays to
look over all beans that are to be used for
seed and destroy all that are discolored.
Never work among the bean-plants when they
are wet, as the disease, if it is present, is
easily spread by this means.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Beets</span> are subject to a <span class='it'>leaf-spot</span>. This
causes small, round, dead spots to appear on
the leaves. Bordeaux mixture applied as
soon as the spots appear and at intervals of
one or two weeks will check this disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cabbage.</span>—<span class='it'>Clubroot</span> is a disease which
causes the roots of cabbage, cauliflower,
kohlrabi, and allied plants to become swollen
and deformed, and prevents them from
functioning properly. If it is not noticed
at transplanting-time the first indication of
its presence is the sudden wilting of the
plants. All affected plants should be destroyed.
The seedbed and that part of the
garden where the cabbages are to be planted
should be limed two or three months before
planting. Use between fifty and sixty pounds
of air-slaked lime on a plot twenty by twenty
feet, and thoroughly mix it with the soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Corn.</span>—<span class='it'>Corn smut</span> usually appears as swellings,
covered with a silvery membrane, on
the tassels or ears. These break open later
and disclose the masses of dark-colored spores.
The swellings should be cut off and destroyed
before they burst.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cucumber.</span>—<span class='it'>Anthracnose, angular leafspot</span>,
and <span class='it'>downy mildew</span> are diseases attacking
the leaves of cucumbers which can be controlled
to some extent by frequent spraying
with Bordeaux mixture. This should be applied
as soon as the diseases are noticed and
repeated at intervals of one or two weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Peas</span> are affected by a <span class='it'>mildew</span> which shows
itself on the leaves and pods as a whitish
mold. The plants should be dusted with
powdered sulphur, or sprayed with potassium-sulphide
solution to which resin fish-oil soap
has been added to make it stick to the leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Potato.</span>—Two important diseases affecting
potatoes are <span class='it'>scab</span> and <span class='it'>late blight</span>. The
former is a disease which lives in the soil and
is also carried over on infected potatoes.
It shows itself as scabby spots on the tubers.
Seed potatoes can be disinfected by soaking
them, before they are cut, for two hours in a
solution of one part Formalin to two hundred
and forty parts water. This treatment will
not prevent scab if the soil is already infected.
An alkaline soil favors the growth of this
disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Late blight</span> appears late in the season and
causes the leaves to blacken, become watery,
and decay, often accompanied with an
offensive odor. The disease also penetrates
the tubers and renders them unfit for storage
purposes. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture
is practised as a preventive measure. It
should be applied when the plants are six
inches high, and repeated at intervals of about
ten days until the crop is mature. Crops can
be obtained without spraying, but Bordeaux
mixture may be considered as a form of insurance.
Lead arsenate may be added to
the Bordeaux mixture if potato-beetles are
present.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tomato.</span>—<span class='it'>Tomato leaf-spot</span> is a disease
which causes dark-brown spots to appear on
the leaves. The areas attacked shrivel and
die. Spray with Bordeaux mixture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is just as important to apply remedial or
preventive measures early in the case of
diseases as it is in controlling insect pests.
Fine mist-like sprays should be used as
recommended for applying stomach poisons,
and for the same reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span></p>
<div><h1>XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CULTURE OF VEGETABLES IN DETAIL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>This</span> chapter is devoted to hints on the
cultivation of the more important
vegetables, together with some mention of
varieties suited for “war-garden” planting.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Artichoke, Jerusalem.</span>—This has about
the same food value as the potato, but, unfortunately,
it is a rather tasteless product.
Proper cooking, with the addition of sauces
and condiments, will make it palatable. It
is a tall, coarse-growing plant belonging to the
sunflower family. If you have an out-of-the-way
spot in your garden where nothing else
will grow, try a few artichokes. It needs sunshine,
but is not particular as to soil. It
should be planted in the spring on ground that
has had a dressing of barn-yard manure
spaded in. Plant the tubers a foot apart in
rows two feet apart. The plant is a perennial,
and likely to become a troublesome weed
unless restricted to one corner of the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Beans.</span>—This group comprises some of the
most important of garden vegetables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The various types of beans differ greatly in
their requirements, and there is scarcely any
kind of soil or climate that will support
vegetation, where beans of one kind or another
cannot be grown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the beans are very susceptible to
cold and must not be planted until the soil
has warmed up and all danger of frost is past.
There is one kind, however, belonging to a
different genus than the common beans,
which is not harmed by frost and which requires
a long, cool season to develop properly.
This is the broad, or Windsor, bean. A rich
clay loam is best suited to this plant, and the
seeds must be planted just as soon as the
ground is in condition to be worked on in
the spring. Plant them in rows two feet
apart, and three inches apart in the rows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ordinary garden beans can be divided
into two groups—the pole beans, which can be
subdivided into those of the string and Lima
types; and the bush beans, comprising string-beans,
green and wax podded, green-shell
beans, dry-shell beans, and Limas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pole beans, especially the Limas, are
very susceptible to cold and cannot be
planted outdoors in the vicinity of New
York until toward the end of May, and not
until June if it happens to be a cool season.
They require a light, fertile soil for their best
development. Seeds can be planted in hills
three feet apart each way, placing three or
four seeds in each hill. Poles must be provided
for them to climb on and these should
be in place before the seeds are planted.
They can also be planted and trained on a
trellis, as described in Chapter X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bush beans of the string type are less
affected by cold than the preceding, but are
not very hardy in this respect. They may
be planted as soon as danger of frost is past
if the ground is not too cold and wet. The
distance between the rows should be about
eighteen inches, the plants standing from
three to four inches apart in the rows. Bush
beans will grow in a variety of soils ranging
from those of a sandy nature to clay loams,
but they grow best in sandy loam. Shell
beans of the Improved Navy type (pea-beans)
are especially adapted for planting in
sandy soils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bush Lima beans require the same kind of
soil as the pole beans, and should be planted
at the same time. Make the rows two feet
apart, with the plants from six to nine
inches apart in the row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following are good varieties. Of the
dwarf, wax-podded kinds <span class='it'>Rust-proof Golden
Wax</span> and <span class='it'>Burpee’s Kidney</span> are desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Bountiful</span>, a flat-podded type, and <span class='it'>Valentine</span>,
a round-podded kind, are good examples
of dwarf, green snap-beans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the pole beans we have <span class='it'>Golden Carmine</span>
and <span class='it'>Golden Cluster</span>, both wax-pods, and
<span class='it'>Kentucky Wonder</span>, an excellent, green snap-bean
and also suitable for providing dry-shell
beans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of beans that are grown for their seeds the
following may be noted: <span class='it'>Dwarf Horticultural</span>
(can also be used as a snap-bean), <span class='it'>Improved
Navy</span>, and <span class='it'>White Marrow</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Limas are represented by two forms,
the dwarf and the climbing kinds. Good
dwarf Limas are <span class='it'>Burpee’s Improved</span>, and <span class='it'>Fordhook</span>.
For planting in the Northern states,
<span class='it'>Leviathan</span>, which is a quick-maturing variety,
is very suitable. This and <span class='it'>King of the Garden</span>,
a very productive kind, are pole, or
climbing, Limas.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Beets</span> are one of the hardy vegetables
which can be planted as soon as the ground
has been prepared in the spring. There are
two distinct kinds of beets—those which have
a globular or flat root, and those with a long,
tapering root. The latter are of slower
growth than the round kinds, and are very
suitable for winter storage, but their cultivation
should not be attempted unless the
soil is deep and of a sandy nature. The globe
beets are the best for the home gardener.
For the first planting a quick-maturing kind,
such as <span class='it'>Crosby’s Egyptian</span>, should be chosen.
For later plantings <span class='it'>Detroit Dark Red</span> is suitable,
and this is a good variety to plant toward
the end of June or early July to form
roots suitable for winter storage. Beets can
be planted in rows from twelve to eighteen
inches apart. After the seedlings have
reached a height of two or three inches they
should be thinned out to stand four inches
apart in the row. If desired, these thinnings
may be taken up carefully, so as not to break
the roots, and transplanted in another part
of the garden. Another plan is to defer thinning
until the plants are from four to six
inches in height, and then use the thinnings
as “greens.” Beets will grow in almost any
soil, but the best crops are produced on
sandy loams.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cabbage</span> may be grown as an early crop,
to mature around June or July, or as a late
crop, to mature in the fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The early crop is usually produced from
seeds sown in a greenhouse or hotbed in
February or early March, the young plants
being set out in April. They require plenty
of room for development and should be
planted so as to stand from eighteen inches to
two feet apart in the rows, the rows being
two and one-half to three feet apart. <span class='it'>Early
Jersey Wakefield</span> is the variety commonly
grown for an early crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeds for the late crop can be sown in May.
If sown outdoors, a plot of rich, sandy soil
(a square yard will produce an ample supply
of seedlings for most home gardens) should
be chosen. If the plot has been limed a short
time previous it is an advantage, as an
alkaline soil lessens the liability to club root,
a disease which prevents proper development
of the cabbage. The resultant seedlings
should be set out in July. As late cabbages
are stronger growers and form larger
heads than the early kinds, they should be
given more room—three feet between the
rows and two feet apart in the rows. A
standard variety for late planting is <span class='it'>Flat
Dutch</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cabbages will succeed in a variety of soils,
but to get best results heavy applications of
decayed stable manure should be incorporated
with the soil before planting. Surface dressings
of nitrate of soda are also beneficial.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Carrot.</span>—This crop can be planted any
time after the ground is in condition in the
spring up to July, which is a suitable time to
sow seeds for the crop designed for winter
storage. The quick-maturing kinds, such as
<span class='it'>Early Scarlet Horn</span>, should be sown first,
choosing the warmest position in the garden.
These will be ready for use in a short time,
when they may be harvested and the ground
used for another crop. For later crops
<span class='it'>Danver’s Half-long</span> may be used. Carrot
seed should be sown in rows a foot or fifteen
inches apart and one-half inch deep. The
early varieties should be thinned to stand
about two inches apart, while the main crop
needs about four inches between each plant.
Some people defer the thinning of their carrots
until they are of sufficient size for the table.
“Baby” carrots are one of the most delicious
of vegetables when they are properly cooked,
far preferable to the roots that have been
allowed to mature. While this plan has great
advantages, the carrots left behind do not
attain so great a size as would be the case if
thinning had been attended to earlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep, well-cultivated soil is the best for
this crop. In heavy soils that have not been
deeply worked, the short-rooted kinds, such
as <span class='it'>Ox-heart</span>, should be planted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cauliflower.</span>—The cultivation of cauliflower
is substantially the same as that of
cabbage. It is a cool-weather crop, and not
much success is likely to be obtained if
attempts are made to mature it during hot
weather. For this reason it is either planted
early, or as late as possible consistent with
the prospects of maturing the crop. It requires
a light, rich soil. When the heads
begin to form, it is advisable to bend the
outside leaves over and fasten them in such
a way that the head is shaded from the sun.
Cauliflower is emphatically not a crop for
the novice.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Celery.</span>—There are two distinct kinds of
celery—the so-called “self-blanching” varieties,
and the green-leaf kinds. The former are
the earliest to mature, but are not to be compared
for flavor and tenderness with the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seed of the early kinds, of which <span class='it'>White
Plume</span> is an example, is sown in February in a
greenhouse or hotbed. The young plants
should be transplanted once or twice, either
in shallow boxes filled with earth or in the
open ground, before the plants are set out
where they are to mature, in May or June.
Celery naturally forms a long “tap root”
with few fibers. The object of the successive
transplantings is to check this “tap root”
and promote the formation of a mass of
fibrous feeding-roots. The plants are placed
in single or double rows thirty inches or three
feet apart, and from four to six inches apart
in the rows. When they attain sufficient size
they are blanched by placing boards, a foot
wide and as long as can conveniently be
handled, on either side of the row. Other
methods of blanching are by slipping a
drain-pipe over each plant or by wrapping
around them a collar made of stout paper and
tying it in place with twine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seed of late celery is sown about the same
time as the early kinds, or a few weeks later,
and the procedure is the same up until
planting-time, which is early in July. Late
celery is of stronger growth than the early
varieties and needs more room for its development.
The plants should be set in
rows three and a half to four feet apart, and
six inches apart in the rows. In some sections
it is customary to dig a trench six inches or
more deep and plant the celery in this. By
this means watering is facilitated, and it is
easier to blanch the celery later on. This
method is not advisable when the good soil is
shallow, as it results in the roots being
placed in the infertile subsoil. Blanching of
late celery is usually effected by mounding
the stalks with earth dug from between the
rows. Two persons can most advantageously
perform this operation, one holding the
stalks together so that the soil does not fall
into the heart, the other mounding up the
soil and patting it into position with the
back of a spade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not worth while to attempt to grow
celery unless a rich, moist soil is available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good varieties of “self-blanching” celery
are <span class='it'>White Plume</span> and <span class='it'>Golden Self-blanching</span>.
Among the best of the “green-leaf” kinds are
<span class='it'>Giant Pascal</span> and <span class='it'>Winter Queen</span>. The latter
variety has a splendid flavor and keeps well
into the winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Chard.</span>—One of the easiest to grow and
most productive of the pot herbs is Swiss
chard, “silver beet” or “leaf beet” as it is
sometimes called. The seeds should be
sown in rows about eighteen inches apart.
When the plants are about four inches high
they can be thinned so as to stand six inches
apart and the thinnings used as “greens.”
Later on alternate plants should be taken out,
so that finally each plant is a foot away from
the next. After this stage is arrived at the
chard should be picked by pulling off the
outside leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two varieties listed in the catalogues.
One, <span class='it'>Lucullus</span>, has crumpled leaves
and very broad, thick, white midribs. This
is the variety that should be grown when it
is desired to cook and serve the midribs
separately, after the fashion of asparagus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swiss chard is a form of beet which does
not produce edible roots. Nitrate of soda,
as recommended for kohlrabi, is an excellent
fertilizer for this crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Corn</span>, the most delectable of all vegetables,
should receive the attention of all
home gardeners who have sufficient room and
a fairly rich soil. This is a vegetable the
flavor of which rapidly deteriorates after the
ears have been removed from the plant;
therefore the store article can never be as
good as the home-grown kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hill and drill methods of planting each
have their vehement advocates. Good crops
can be obtained either way, but the drill
method is probably best for the small garden.
The seeds are planted in drills two inches
deep, dropping two or three seeds at every
foot. When they germinate, all but the
strongest plant should be pulled up from each
group. The rows can be two and a half feet
apart for the small-growing kinds like <span class='it'>Golden
Bantam</span>, and three feet for the larger varieties
such as <span class='it'>Stowell’s Evergreen</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the hill system of cultivation is
adopted, five or six seeds are planted in
spaces two and a half or three feet apart each
way. The young plants are thinned out to
stand three or four to a hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corn needs to be frequently hoed to get
best results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several methods may be adopted in order to
insure a succession of corn for the table. A
quick-maturing variety may be planted at intervals
of three weeks up to the middle of July,
or, early, midseason, and late varieties may
be planted at the same time in May or June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The removal of the side shoots which
appear in the axils of the leaves at the base
of the plant should be attended to. This is
known as “suckering.” It causes the vigor
of the plant to be concentrated in the production
of ears instead of being frittered
away on side shoots or “suckers” which will
never amount to anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corn should not be planted until the soil
has warmed up and danger of frost is past.
It is permissible, however, to take a chance
with a few rows by sowing early, in the hope
that they will come through all right—say
about the end of April or beginning of May
in those sections which possess a climate
similar to that of New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cucumbers</span> are a crop that requires a fair
amount of room for proper development.
They should be planted in hills five feet
apart each way, with four or five plants in
each hill; or in rows five feet apart, with the
plants standing about one foot apart in the
rows. The seeds should not be planted outdoors
until all danger of frost is past. An
early crop can be obtained by raising the
plants in a greenhouse by sowing the seeds
early in berry-boxes and transplanting outdoors
when the weather is warm enough. It
is a good plan, when planting outdoors, to
sow the seeds rather thickly, about ten seeds
to a hill, so as to get a good stand and lessen
the risk of losing the plants by insect attacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soil most suitable for cucumbers is a
sandy loam that has been well enriched with
decayed stable manure. They will succeed
admirably on newly broken sod land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best cucumbers for outdoor planting
are those belonging to the “white spine”
type, of which <span class='it'>Davis Perfect</span> is a good example.
For supplying small cucumbers for
pickling, <span class='it'>Fordhook Pickling</span> is one of the best
varieties to grow.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Egg-plant</span> is a tropical plant which will
not mature its fruits in the Northern states
unless its season of growth is lengthened by
starting the plants in a greenhouse or hotbed.
It is very susceptible to cold and it is scarcely
safe to set the young plants outdoors until
June in the latitude of New York. Egg-plant
requires a sunny position and a warm,
light, fertile soil. It can be planted in rows
two and a half to three feet apart, two feet
being allowed between the plants in the
rows. <span class='it'>Black Beauty</span> is a standard variety.
<span class='it'>Early Long Purple</span> is a quick-maturing kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Kale.</span>—The cultivation of kale is practically
that of late cabbage. It is an extremely
hardy vegetable and will stand a great deal
of frost.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Kohlrabi</span> is another member of the cabbage
group. It is desirable to mature it
quickly, as slow-grown plants are woody and
inedible. This quick growth is effected by
planting in rich soil and by giving top-dressings
of nitrate of soda at the rate of one ounce
to ten feet of row. The swollen stems should
be eaten when they are about two inches in
diameter. <span class='it'>Early Vienna</span>, either white or
purple top, is a good variety. The seeds
may be sown in the spring just as soon as
the ground can be worked, in rows from
fifteen to eighteen inches apart. When the
young plants are large enough they are
thinned to stand six inches apart in the
rows; if so desired, the thinnings may be
used as “greens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Lettuce</span>, the most important salad crop,
requires a rich, sandy soil. It is seldom that
it will “head” properly in city backyards,
because of unsuitable soil and other adverse
conditions. Lettuce is a cool-weather crop,
and during the hot days of summer the
greatest difficulty is experienced in growing it.
There are several different types. The loose-leaf
kinds, those that do not form a head,
are the easiest to grow. The other forms are
the Romaine, or Cos, which makes a columnar
head, and the ordinary kind, or cabbage
lettuce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seeds should be planted shallowly in
rows a foot or eighteen inches apart, and
afterward the young plants must be thinned
to stand ten or twelve inches apart in the
row. A row twenty feet long is enough to
plant at one sowing. Other plantings should
be made at intervals of two or three weeks,
so as to provide a succession. During hot
weather the plants are benefited by being
shaded with cheese-cloth screens. These
can be conveniently made by tacking cheese-cloth
on lath frames of suitable size, which
should be supported on stakes driven into
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick growth is essential to obtain crisp,
well-flavored lettuce. This can partially be
brought about by the use of nitrate of soda,
as recommended for kohlrabi. Avoid getting
any of the nitrate on the leaves of the plants,
as it will burn them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good varieties of lettuce are <span class='it'>May King</span>
and <span class='it'>Hanson</span>, belonging to the cabbage-head
type; <span class='it'>Grand Rapids</span>, a loose-leaf variety; and
<span class='it'>Paris White Cos</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In cities sparrows are frequently troublesome
to growers of lettuce, as they are fond of
picking off the leaves of the young plants.
Protection is effected by stretching several
strands of strong thread a few inches above
the rows. The sparrows become very suspicious
of an arrangement of this kind, and
it is usually efficacious in keeping them away
from the plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Muskmelon.</span>—The cultivation of this crop
is very much like that of cucumber. Muskmelons
are rather more susceptible to cold
than the latter, and in consequence the soil
and air must be warm before they are planted.
The soil must be well drained or they will not
succeed. When they have to be planted on
land that is cold and poorly drained it is a
good plan to plant them on ridges or mounds,
about two feet across, raised six inches or so
above the general level. This assists the
soil in warming up and insures better drainage.
A layer of decayed manure about three
inches thick, buried in the hills where the
plants are to grow, greatly helps this crop and
others of a similar nature, such as cucumbers,
squash, and pumpkin. Frequent cultivation
of the surface soil is necessary to stimulate
growth, keep down weeds, and conserve
moisture, when the plants are young. Good
varieties of muskmelon are <span class='it'>Emerald Gem</span>, a
small or salmon-fleshed form, and <span class='it'>Rocky Ford</span>
and <span class='it'>Hackensack</span>, which are of medium size
with green flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Okra.</span>—The cultivation of okra is very
similar to that of corn, although otherwise
they have nothing else in common. It
succeeds best in a sandy, well-fertilized loam.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Onion.</span>—There are two ways of producing
a crop of onions—from “sets” and from
seed. “Sets” are small onions produced by
sowing seed very thickly in rather poor soil
and allowing the plants to mature as they
stand. This results in a crop of small bulbs
which are stored over the winter and sold the
following spring as onion “sets.” There are
two methods of raising onions from seed.
The plants may be obtained by sowing the
seed in a greenhouse in February, transplanting
the seedlings to the open ground in
April. The procedure most commonly followed,
however, is to plant the seeds in rows
a foot apart, in the position where they are to
mature, as early as possible in the spring.
When the young plants appear they are
thinned to four inches apart. If the seedlings
are left until they are the thickness of a lead-pencil
they may be pulled and used as a salad
in the form of bunch onions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crop can be produced earlier by the use
of “sets.” These are planted in furrows two
inches deep, spacing them two inches apart.
The soil is then drawn over them and firmed.
After some growth has been made, alternate
plants may be pulled out and used as salad,
leaving the remainder to mature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thorough preparation of the soil is essential
to achieve success in growing onions. It
should be dug up as deeply as possible,
thoroughly pulverized, and afterward compacted
by rolling with a garden roller or by
tramping. Onions succeed best on soil which
is fairly retentive of moisture and rich in
nitrogen. Top-dressings of hen or sheep
manure, or of nitrate of soda, are beneficial
to this crop. Remember what has been said
previously with regard to taking care not to
apply too much of any of these fertilizers.
Weeding is a very important operation in
connection with onion-growing, and some of
it, when the weeds are close to or in the rows,
has to be done by hand. If the weeds are
allowed to obtain a headway the crop will
suffer greatly in consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In wet seasons, and when planted in rich,
retentive soils, the bulbs sometimes fail to
mature at the proper time. When they show
signs of growing too late in the fall, it is
customary to go over the plot and break
over the tops. This can be done by dragging
a board over the onion-bed, or, if the plot is a
small one, it may be done by hand. This
process arrests growth and causes the bulbs
to mature so that they are suitable for winter
storage. Immature bulbs will not keep
properly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standard varieties of onion are <span class='it'>Yellow
Danvers</span> and <span class='it'>Southport Globe</span>, which can be
obtained in red, white, and yellow forms.
<span class='it'>Prize-taker</span> is a very large, mild onion which
succeeds best when started in a greenhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Parsley</span> succeeds best in a clay loam soil
that has been well fertilized with stable
manure. The seeds are slow to germinate
and it is frequently four or five weeks before
the young plants show themselves above the
ground. Growth may be hastened by soaking
the seeds in tepid water for twenty-four
hours before sowing them. They should be
planted in rows a foot apart and the young
plants thinned to stand six inches apart.
<span class='it'>Champion Moss Curled</span> is a good variety.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Parsnip.</span>—A long season is required for
the development of large roots. The seeds
should be sown in April in rows from fifteen
to eighteen inches apart, afterward thinning
the seedlings so that they stand six inches
apart. The seeds are slow in germinating and
it is a good plan to sow a few seeds of radish
in the drill with them. The radishes germinate
quickly and serve to break the surface
crust and to mark the row so that cultivation
may be performed close to the row without
disturbing the parsnip seeds. The radishes
are mature and can be pulled and used for
the table by the time the parsnips have appeared
above the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep, loamy soil is most suited for the
production of parsnips. In a shallow soil the
roots are likely to be stunted and misshapen.
The following method of producing extra-large
and well-shaped roots is sometimes used
by exhibitors of vegetables. Holes about
two feet deep and three inches in diameter
at the top are made in the ground with a
crowbar at intervals of about nine inches.
These holes are filled with sifted fertile earth,
and three or four seeds planted in each.
When the seedlings appear, all but the
strongest are pulled out. This method is
only to be recommended when it is desired
to walk off with the prize for the best parsnips
at the county fair or the town vegetable
show. <span class='it'>Hollow Crown</span> is a good variety.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Peas</span> are essentially a cool-weather crop,
and they especially resent hot, dry conditions
at the root. For this reason the seeds
should be planted just as soon as the ground
is workable in the spring. The dwarf varieties
can be planted in double rows about six
inches apart, leaving a space of eighteen
inches or two feet between each double row.
The tall varieties, which need support of
some kind, may be planted in the same way,
but a space varying from three to five feet
must be allowed between the rows, according
to the height of the variety planted. The
taller the variety, the greater is the necessity
for ample space between the rows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said to be possible to produce a crop
of peas in the fall by sowing the seeds in
August, but the writer has never seen much
success attained with a crop at this season;
at any rate, not in the vicinity of New York.
For a late crop of peas it is advisable to dig a
trench from six to eight inches deep and sow
the seeds in this, covering them with two
inches of soil, as usual. Water them thoroughly
if the weather is dry. As the plants
grow the earth should be gradually drawn
into the trench until it is filled up to the surrounding
level. This system is adopted so
that the roots may be well down in the earth
and thus protected from the hot rays of the
sun. This is also a good method to adopt
for late spring plantings of peas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fairly fertile, loamy soil, well drained, but
of a retentive nature, is most suited to peas.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>First of All</span>, thirty inches high, is a good
variety of the smooth-seeded type of pea.
This type does not possess such a good flavor
as the wrinkled-seeded kinds, but the seeds
are not likely to rot if planted in cold, wet
soil. <span class='it'>Nott’s Excelsior</span> is an excellent dwarf
variety of the wrinkled-seed type. Of the
tall kinds, <span class='it'>Alderman</span>, five feet in height,
<span class='it'>Gradus</span>, thirty inches, and <span class='it'>Champion of
England</span>, five feet, are to be recommended.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Peppers</span> require very much the same conditions
as tomatoes and egg-plant, except that
they may be planted somewhat closer together.
The rows should be from eighteen inches to
two feet apart, with the plants spaced from
one to two feet apart in the rows. <span class='it'>Bull Nose</span>
and <span class='it'>Chinese Giant</span> are good examples of the
mild, sweet kinds, with <span class='it'>Golden Queen</span> to give
color variation in the salad made from them.
<span class='it'>Long Red Cayenne</span> and <span class='it'>Red Chili</span> should be
chosen if the peppery varieties are desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Potato.</span>—The largest crops of potatoes are
produced in cool, moist, climates such as are
found in Great Britain, parts of Europe, and,
in the United States, in Maine and Michigan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soils best suited for potatoes are
fertile, rather sandy loams which should be
fairly retentive of moisture. A soil of this
nature which has been heavily fertilized with
barn-yard manure the preceding year may be
considered ideal for potato culture. The
use of barn-yard manure, particularly if it is
fresh, is inadvisable if the soil contains a good
proportion of humus and is in good physical
condition. It is claimed that the practice of
using barn-yard manure the current season
causes the crop to be more susceptible to
attacks of potato scab. Many of the largest
growers of potatoes refrain from fertilizing
directly with barn-yard manure, but rely
instead on the use of commercial fertilizers.
These may be applied broadcast over the
field in the spring, after the soil has been
plowed, and harrowed in. If only a small
quantity of fertilizer is available, it is preferable
to apply it by spreading it in the furrows,
but thoroughly mixing it in the soil before
the potatoes are planted. The fertilizer obtainable
from most seedsmen under the name
of “potato manure” can safely be used in the
furrows at the rate of five pounds to a plot of
four hundred square feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seed” potatoes should consist of medium-sized
tubers, Northern grown, and free from
disease. Although whole potatoes may be
planted, the usual practice is to cut them into
pieces, each piece containing two or three
“eyes,” or buds. When cutting the potatoes
for sets make each piece as “chunky” as
possible so that there is a good-sized piece of
potato for the “eyes” to draw upon for their
food supply until they have formed a root
system of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two methods of planting potatoes—in
hills and in furrows or rows. In the hill
system of planting, the plants are spaced from
two to three feet apart either way, the distance
being dependent on the vigor of the
variety. When planted in furrows the rows
are spaced from two to three feet apart and
the sets placed from twelve to eighteen inches
apart in the rows. The early varieties may
be planted about four inches deep, and the
late varieties about six inches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the shoots appear above the ground
the surface soil should be cultivated to conserve
moisture and to keep down weeds.
Later in the season when the tubers are
being formed it is customary to hill them up
with earth so as to cover the tubers and
prevent “greening,” and also to assist in
keeping the roots cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The potato is particularly susceptible to
environmental conditions. A variety that
may be an excellent cropper in one section
may be an utter failure in another. It is
thus difficult to recommend any particular
variety. The best plan for those who are to
attempt the cultivation of potatoes is to
make inquiry in the neighborhood with a
view to finding the variety that is most
successful in that locality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following are standard varieties that
are widely grown: early varieties—<span class='it'>Irish

varieties—<span class='it'>Carman No. 1</span>, <span class='it'>Green Mountain</span>,
and <span class='it'>Rural New-Yorker</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Pumpkins</span> will succeed under practically the
same conditions as outlined for cucumber and
melon. They are also subject to the same insect
pests. This crop is frequently grown in
the corn-patch, in hills about eight feet apart
each way, planting five or six seeds to a hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Radishes</span> are only palatable when they
have been grown very quickly. If they are
slow in coming to maturity the product is
pithy and worthless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light, rich soil is most suited to the production
of radishes. The seeds should be
sown in rows nine inches or a foot apart and
the seedlings thinned to about two inches.
It does not pay to transplant radishes.
Five or six feet of row is sufficient to plant
at one time, securing a succession by planting
other batches at intervals of about ten days.
Radishes are usually not in great demand
during the summer months, as the home
grower has been surfeited by his spring crop.
Those who are so fond of radishes that they
want them throughout the whole season
should plant <span class='it'>White Strasburg</span> or <span class='it'>Icicle</span> to
mature during the hot weather, and <span class='it'>Cardinal
Globe</span>, <span class='it'>Round Red Forcing</span>, or <span class='it'>French Breakfast</span>
for an early crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Winter radishes</span>, which form very large
roots and may be stored by the same methods
adopted for beets and carrots, are usually
sown about the end of July or beginning of
August. They need more space in which to
mature—about eighteen inches between the
rows and six inches in the rows.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Rutabaga.</span>—See <span class='sc'>Turnip</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Salsify</span> or <span class='it'>Vegetable Oyster</span> is a vegetable
that is coming into more general use.
Seeds are sown early in the spring on deeply
broken ground in rows fifteen inches apart,
and the plants thinned to three inches. The
roots are dug in the fall and stored like beets,
or they may be left in the ground and dug
when required for use, if the weather permits.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Spinach</span> is a cool-weather crop that requires
a light soil heavily manured with decayed
stable manure for best results. The
seeds should be planted in very early spring
or in September, in rows fifteen inches apart,
and the plants thinned to stand four inches
apart. Nitrate of soda as recommended for
kohlrabi is good for this crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Spinach (New Zealand).</span>—Although
called spinach, this is an entirely different
plant and belongs to another family. It
luxuriates during hot weather and will supply
the table plentifully with “greens” throughout
the summer. Seeds should be planted
during April or May in rows two feet apart,
the plants later being thinned to one foot.
When the plants attain a foot in height
picking may begin, using the tender shoot-tips,
or leaves, as required. The thinnings,
of course, are also available for cooking.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Squash.</span>—Cultivate the same as cucumber.
The bush varieties should be planted four
feet apart each way, and the vining kinds
from six to eight feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are several different types of squash.
The summer kinds are represented by the
<span class='it'>Pattypan</span> and <span class='it'>Crookneck</span> types, and the winter
varieties by the <span class='it'>Hubbard</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are subject to much the same insect
pests and diseases as the cucumber and
muskmelon.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Sweet Potatoes</span> are not very well adapted
for Northern gardens, although they are
grown to a considerable extent in parts of
New Jersey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They succeed best in a rich, sandy soil.
The “sets” are usually planted on slightly
raised, broad ridges about four feet apart.
They are spaced from twelve to eighteen
inches apart along the ridges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The production of “sets” is usually effected
by placing small potatoes in a hotbed and
covering them with sand. This causes them
to sprout, and when the shoots are six or
eight inches in length they are pulled off with
roots attached and planted as described.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Yellow Jersey</span> is a good variety for Northern
planting.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Swiss Chard.</span>—See under <span class='sc'>Chard</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tomato.</span>—This plant adapts itself to a
great variety of soils, and will succeed almost
anywhere if it receives warmth and sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is seldom worth while for any one without
greenhouse facilities, unless he wishes to
have the experience, to raise tomatoes from
seed. Young plants can be obtained at a low
cost at planting-time from seedsmen who have
every convenience for raising them cheaply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distance apart between the plants
when they are set out in the garden depends
on the method of training adopted. The
truck farmers and market gardeners seldom
go to the trouble of staking their plants.
They are simply set out in the field three or
four feet apart each way and allowed to
grow naturally. This results in the spoiling
of some of the fruit through coming in contact
with the soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The home gardener can usually afford the
time and trouble required to stake his tomatoes,
and receives his reward in the shape of
more fruit of better quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One method of training is to set out the
plants a foot apart in rows three feet apart.
If this scheme is adopted each plant must be
supplied with a stout stake to which it is
tied, and the plant must be restricted to a
single stem. This last is effected by pinching
out the side shoots with thumb and finger as
soon as they are formed. Avoid taking off
the flowering shoots or you will have no
fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another method is to set the plants three
feet by two feet, and support them as described
in Chapter X. In this case it is
advisable to prune out the thin, spindly
shoots which frequently congregate in the
centers of the plants. This causes the vigor
of the plant to be concentrated in the strong,
fruiting shoots, admits light and air, resulting
in better ripened tomatoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They can also be trained on the south side
of the house, supporting them with tape or
cloth passed around the shoots and fastened
to the wall with tacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Favorite tomatoes are <span class='it'>Chalk’s Early Jewel</span>
for an early crop, <span class='it'>Stone</span> and <span class='it'>Ponderosa</span> for
main crop. In small gardens <span class='it'>Dwarf Stone</span> can
be used to advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Turnip</span> is a hardy crop well suited for
early spring or late fall cultivation. For the
early crop such varieties as <span class='it'>Snowball</span> or <span class='it'>Early
White Milan</span> should be planted. The seed
may be sown as soon as the ground is prepared
in the spring, in rows a foot apart.
When they are large enough the young plants
must be thinned out to stand about four
inches apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Yellow Globe</span>, <span class='it'>Golden Ball</span>, or the white
strap-leaf kinds may be sown for fall use.
They are cultivated in the same way as the
preceding except that the seeds are sown in
July or August.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Rutabaga turnips</span> grow much larger than the
preceding, require more room, and a longer
period for development. They can be sown
in May or June in rows two feet apart, and
the young plants thinned out to stand about
ten inches apart in the rows. Treated in this
way, they will form large roots suitable for
winter storage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turnips succeed best in a loamy soil in
which there has been incorporated a liberal
supply of well-decayed stable manure.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Watermelon.</span>—These plants succeed under
much the same conditions, and need the
same treatment as muskmelon. They are
rampant growers and the hills should be
spaced about eight feet apart each way.
They are, therefore, not adapted for cultivation
in very small gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The striped cucumber-beetle is also partial
to watermelon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For planting in Northern gardens, quick-maturing
varieties such as <span class='it'>Cole’s Early</span> and
<span class='it'>Fordhook</span> should be planted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span></p>
<div><h1>XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HARVESTING AND STORING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> flavor and tenderness of many vegetables
depend in a large measure on
their being harvested at the proper time.
The picking of string-beans should be early,
constant, and methodical, partly because
old beans are stringy and unpalatable and
partly because, if picking is neglected and
the plants allowed to form seed, production
ceases. Peas should always be picked just as
soon as the pods are well filled, before the
seeds commence to harden. Their flavor
deteriorates if they are picked more than an
hour or two before they are needed for the
table. The same remarks apply to sweet
corn. There is an old saying that “the pot
should be boiling before the ears are picked
from the plant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great care should be taken in harvesting
beets. If the roots are bruised or broken, or
if the leaves are cut off too close to the root,
the color of the beets, one of their greatest
attractions, will be lost in cooking. The
crispness of salad plants—celery, lettuce,
radish, and onion—is enhanced if they are
gathered early in the morning and stood in
water in a shady, cool place until they are
required for use. Such crops as Brussells
sprouts, kale, celery, and parsnips are considered
to be improved in flavor after they
have been slightly frozen. The fruits of
tomato, watermelon, and muskmelon should
be allowed to ripen on the plants. Muskmelons
are ripe when the fruit parts readily
from the stem on being lifted in the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Proper harvesting is a prime necessity if
vegetables are to be successfully stored for
winter use. Bruised, broken or diseased
vegetables should always be rejected, as decay
is almost certain to take place when they are
stored, and this is likely to spread to the sound
vegetables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cellar with an earthen floor, well ventilated
and frost-proof, in which a temperature
of from 40° to 45° Fahr. can be maintained,
forms a splendid storage-place for potatoes,
the majority of the root crops, and some of
the leaf vegetables. If there is a furnace in
the cellar which raises the temperature too
much, the coolness required may be obtained
by partitioning off part of the cellar, preferably
in a corner containing a window, so that
ventilation may be secured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite a number of vegetables can be successfully
stored in the open by burying them
in pits or trenches and covering with straw,
salt hay, and earth. Some of the disadvantages
of this method are the inaccessibility of
the vegetables when the weather is severe,
and the difficulty of looking them over
occasionally so that diseased and decayed
specimens may be removed. When storing
vegetables in this way it is important that
the whole of the covering should not be put
on at one time, as this endangers the whole
pile of vegetables through the possibility of
heating.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Root, Tuber, and Bulb Crops</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Artichoke (Jerusalem).</span>—The tubers of
this plant are unaffected by frost and may be
allowed to remain in the ground all winter.
In those sections where the frost penetrates
the ground deeply a supply sufficient for use
during the winter should be dug in the fall
and stored in sand in a cool cellar.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Parsnip</span>, <span class='sc'>Horseradish</span>, and <span class='sc'>Salsify</span> may
be treated in the same way as the preceding.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Beets</span> should be carefully dug up after the
first frost and handled gently to avoid breaking
or bruising them. Cut off the leaves
about an inch above the roots and pack them
with moist sand or earth in boxes in a cool
cellar. Covering the roots in this way maintains
their freshness and prevents shriveling.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Carrots.</span>—In the fall large numbers of
fibrous roots are produced on the sides of the
large tap-root. These roots spoil the symmetry
of the carrots and impair their flavor.
The crop should therefore be harvested before
these fibrous roots form. Observation of the
roots is the only way of determining the
proper time to dig them up. In other respects
they are stored the same as beets.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Potatoes</span> for winter use should be dug on
a dry day as soon as possible after the tops
have died down. Leave them lying on the
surface of the ground for a few hours, so that
they may dry properly. (It is inadvisable to
allow them to be exposed to the light for
too long a period, as it will cause the tubers to
become green and unfit for use.) They can
then be gathered up and placed in boxes or
barrels in a cool, frost-proof cellar, but not
exposed to the light. All diseased or injured
tubers should be laid aside for immediate
use, provided they are not too far gone, in
which case they may be boiled and fed to
pigs or chickens, or destroyed by burning, so
as to avoid the possibility of spreading
disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Potatoes may also be stored outdoors in
sections where the winters are not too severe.
A high-lying sandy piece of ground should be
chosen on which to make the “pit.” Dig out
the soil for a depth of about six inches and
line the excavation with three inches of straw.
Place the potatoes in a pile on this and cover
with a similar thickness of straw or hay.
Place over this a layer of earth three inches
thick to prevent the straw from blowing
away. Gradually increase the covering as the
weather becomes more severe, until a thickness
of a foot or eighteen inches is reached.
A layer of manure over this is advisable in
very cold climates. If the pile is a large one
it is important that ventilation should be provided
for. This may be accomplished by sticking
a stovepipe into the center of the pile and
allowing the top to project above the covering
of earth, or by allowing a tuft of the straw
that forms the first covering to extend in
the same manner. This vent-hole must be
covered with a board, a piece of oilcloth, or
something similar to prevent rain from entering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other vegetables that may be stored in this
way are <span class='it'>beets, carrots, turnips, salsify</span>, and
<span class='it'>parsnips</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Rutabagas</span> and <span class='sc'>Turnips</span> require to be
dug up before severe frost. They can be
stored the same way as potatoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Sweet Potatoes</span> are very difficult to store
over the winter. The loss through decay in
storage is enormous every year, even though
proper facilities are obtainable. They need a
warm, dry room and a constant temperature.
The less they are handled after being stored
the better. The best advice for those who
have raised a crop of this vegetable is to
avoid loss by eating them as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Onions</span> should be properly “cured” before
they are stored. This is accomplished by
harvesting them during dry, settled weather,
and allowing them to lie in windrows two or
three days before bringing them indoors.
They should then be placed in a cool, airy
room in slatted crates, so that air has free
access to them. If wet weather is prevalent
at harvesting-time they may be “cured” by
placing them in a single layer under cover
until they are thoroughly dry. The dead
leaves and loose scales should be pulled off
before storing them.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Leaf Crops</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cabbages</span> can be stored by digging them
up with some soil attached to the roots, and
packing them close together on the floor of
a cool cellar. Treated in this way, they are
a rather “smelly” vegetable, and, unless the
cellar is tightly shut off from the rest of the
house, likely to cause some unpleasantness.
They can be stored outside in the way recommended
for potatoes by placing them head
downward in a trench or pit.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cauliflower.</span>—It is possible to preserve
cauliflower, for a short time only, by digging
them with roots attached and suspending
them head downward in a cool, moist
cellar.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Celery</span> can be dug in the fall and packed
closely in boxes in an upright position in a
cool cellar. The more roots and soil adhering
to the plants the better the chance of success.
When the soil dries out it must be watered,
but be very careful not to get any water on the
leaves or leaf-stalks. Another way of caring
for celery is to dig a trench deep enough to
accommodate the plants when they are
placed upright. Pack them as tightly as
possible in this and cover with boards to keep
out rain. In severe weather it will be necessary
to put on an additional covering of
straw and earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Parsley.</span>—In sections where the winter is
not too severe parsley may be kept green
through the greater part of the winter by
covering the patch with a bottomless box,
with a pane of glass for covering the top.
The box should be banked with manure or
leaves, and the glass covered with straw in
very cold weather. Parsley can also be dug
up, placed in plant-pots, making the soil firm
about the roots, and kept in a cool, sunny
room.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Seed or Fruit Crops</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Beans.</span>—Dry-shell beans should be allowed
to stay on the plants until the pods dry up
and become yellow. They may then be
gathered, and shelled when convenient. If
they are infested with weevils they should
be dry baked in a temperature of about 145°
Fahr. Care must be taken not to allow the
temperature to rise above this figure, or the
beans will be roasted and spoiled. Fumigating
with carbon disulphide is also an
efficacious expedient, but somewhat dangerous
because of the explosive properties of the
fumigant.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Pumpkin</span> and <span class='sc'>Winter Squash</span> can be
stored in a warm, dry room. It is advisable
to turn over the fruits selected for storing
two weeks or so before they are harvested,
so that the side that has been lying on the
ground may have its rind hardened by exposure
to sun and air.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>Although concerned primarily with “war
gardens,” the methods advocated can be used
by all vegetable growers who practise intensive
cultivation. The fundamental principles
of soil management also apply equally
to flower-gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The writer has found in his experience that
good crops can be raised, on what would be
usually considered poor soil, by men and
women who know little of horticultural
practices. Larger crops could have been
produced had they known more of the art of
growing vegetables. It is to help such people
that this book has been written, from information
gained during twenty years of
professional experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the earnest hope of the author that
the crops raised by “war gardeners” will be
of such a size as to cause this last chapter to
be the one that is most consulted.</p>
